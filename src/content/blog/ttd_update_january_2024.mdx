It's that time of the month once again !
<br/>
Today is my birthday, and also the montly devlog !
<br/>
Just like last month, not a lot was done due to having work to do, although I still did *some* work
<br/>
<h1 class="text-4xl">Storyline</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    <p>
        While i'm not going to show everything (or anything at all), the storyline went through yet another rewrite. I played a lot of Stardew Valley recently, and the quest aspect of the game was really charming. While I did wanted to add quests anyway, it made me want to make it the main way to advance in game, rather than a fight system.
        <br/>
        I started writting a framework to add quests into the game, as of writting this, I'm not really sure about how I want to make it.

<h1 class="text-4xl">Musics</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    <p>
        For as long as I can remember, the game was relying on free, no copyright musics to provide some ambiance.
        <br/>
        Starting today, Sanic_le_harisson, moderator on my discord and long time IRL friend, is joining in as a compositor. While we are still talking about the musical identity of the game, i'm positive it will be something really cool, as he have a way better sense of detail than I do.

Aside from that, I have nothing more to share. I'm really sorry if those last few months were not as productive as we all would have liked.
