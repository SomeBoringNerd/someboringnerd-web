Hello everyone ! 
<br/>
You know what time it is, it's monthly report time ! (the first one was uploaded on accident...)
<br/>

<br/>
<h1 class="text-4xl">Storyline</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    I cant share a lot of it, but I've been working on the storyline. As it turned out, I never actually wrote any kind of story for the game, just the red string itself. I'd say that for now, 5% of the story was written down. This is the reason why I made some changes to the <a href="/projects/ttd">game's page</a>. I also deleted a prototype screenshot of the protagonist's room.
    <br/>
    The storyline dont include the lore of each relevant character.
    <br/><br/>
    I also did a rough layout of the first part of the game, please note that this is subject to change and likely wont look like that at all once the game release :)

    The green part is the route the player is supposed to take, but nothing will forbid you to explore :)
    <br/>
    I also started working on several ideas for cutscenes. While I dont want to share boring prototypes just yet, I'll have something to show later in the month.

    In the meantime, I started making a checklist for the demo. As the blog post goes, I'll keep you all updated on the matter.

    Not only that, I've also been working on debug tools to make the map making and testing of features faster.

    I have big plans for NPCs, I want to create actual, lively NPCs, that can and will interact between each other, go on with their life, to show the player that no matter where they are, NPCs can live their life without you. This is going to be a pain to program, but I'm positive I'll have something to show before I can release a demo.
    <br/>
    Right now, the first 5 rooms are finished for the demo, out of the 15 I plan to release. The rough outline of what the demo should be is defined, but there's still a lot of work to do.

    \>As always, I'm still learning better way of doing things, I've optimised part of the engine, and still writting code to make things easier for myself.
    <br/>
    \>I started documenting and recording a lot of my working sessions, in order to make actual devlogs on both @SomeBoringNerd and @SomeBoringDev
    <br/>
    \>I started to write the script of an artistic devlog (where I explain gameplay mecanics, art style, and so on) and a technical devlog which goes into more details of how the features mentionned in the artistic devlog are implemented. Dont worry, they wont be a carbon copy of each other, each will have their own personality, so to speak :)
