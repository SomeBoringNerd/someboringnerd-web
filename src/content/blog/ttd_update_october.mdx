Hello everyone ! 
<br/>
In order to keep me going working on Through The Dark, i'll make a blog post every month to explain what I do, as well as exclusive informations about the developpement
<br/>
In order to put a baseline, everything that was made before the first prototype release on <a href="https://someboringnerd.itch.io/through-the-dark">itch.io</a> will remain undocumented, as most of it is engine work, creating a base prototype and so on.
<br/>
So, what happened since then ?

<br/>
<br/>
<h1 class="text-4xl">Starting working on the demo</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    Well, I got started on making a demo, and made so far 4 rooms, with 3 technically working. I'll only show one :

    <br/>
    As you can see, there's a lot going on, mostly i've been toying around with Box2D's light engine, which gave ma a run for my money, as it was a pain to implement due to a lot of misunderstanding of the documentation (video related).

    </center>
    <br/>
    But in the end, I was able to make it work, even if I still need to edit values and try out stuff to make it looking good.
    <br/>
    I also made a rewrite of the GUI code for most interfaces currently in the game, to make those use textures instead of creating the GUI through code, as it was a clusterfuck of vectors that was hard to maintain, see the change here :

        note : lookup is a texture

    <h1 class="text-3xl">Goals for the demo</h1>
    <br/>
    With this demo, my goal is to make a demo that, ideally would have one hour worth of gameplay, introducing the most important one, and the story.

<br/>
<h1 class="text-4xl">Other goals</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    \>I'm planning to revive both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@someboringnerd">SomeBoringNerd</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SomeBoringDev"> Morgane's Garage</a> by making both gameplay devlogs (on SomeBoringNerd) and technical devlogs going into the details of the engine / game on Morgane's Garage.
    <br/>
    \>Once the demo get released, I also plan to make a kickstarter so I can hire a pixel artist that actually know what they are doing (unlike me) and a compositor to create an OST. I wont open a Patreon or something in that regard until I can actually provide people with a game that is playable from start to finish.
    <br/>
    \>Once the demo get released, a steam page will be made.
