Hello there !
<br/>
This month have been somewhat productive, for once ! let me show ya :
<br/>
<h1 class="text-4xl">Storyline</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    <p>
        I FINALLY KNOW WHAT I WANT FOR THE STORY !<br/>
        <br/>
        With the help of my friend Sanic, we went through a lot of ideas for the story, and I wrote down every good idea we got. With that out of the way, I will be able to maintain the "March of 2024 to release a proper demo".
    </p>

<h1 class="text-4xl">Code</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    <h1 class="text-2xl">Actual progress</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>
        \- I started to rewrite the way pathfinding work, it was too unpredictable for my likings/
        <br/>
        \- The quest system is now fully integrated to the game, albeit in a rushed way.
    </p>
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-2xl">Rant about past me</h1>
    <br/>
    <p>
        This month was spent mostly rewritting old code that was either total garbage, ugly, or flat out didnt worked.
        <br/>
        While most of the code base is now somewhat okay looking, there's some parts that are messy, and I dont think I can realisticly do anything about it.
        <br/>
        For instance, did you know that the code in charge of the textbox (just showing it, doing text and stuff) is bigger than the code that manage the entire room system ? That's right, a simple object is bigger in term of code than a critical part of the engine. 
        <br/>
        *and as time goes on, it dont seems that it will change*

<h1 class="text-4xl">The demo</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    <p>
        For this demo, I have several things I want to do with it.
        <br/>
        \- Introduce the story to the players
        <br/>
        \- Define an art guideline for myself
        <br/>
        \- Get feedback on the parts of the game already in place
        <br/>
        My goal is to reach all of those points before the end of the month. If everything goes as planned, I will be able to make a blog post before april.

<h1 class="text-4xl">More nerd stuff</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    <p>
        For the longest time, I was a Unity dev, but since 2022, I tried as much as possible to get off of it for multiple reasons.
        <br/>
        Right now, my game run in Java using LibGDX as a backend. The thing is, from the get-go, I didnt wrote the low level stuff in a completly separate way from the game itself.
        <br/>
        After the demo is out, I'm going to rewrite the entire game from scratch, in Kotlin this time, and still using LibGDX.
        <br/>
        For the end user, it wont change anything. But for me ? I'll have a chance of restarting on a clean state, but without the hassle of figuring out what need to be programmed.
        <br/>
        For now, the demo is 90% done, the maps are finished, albeit in a rushed state, the global layout is done, the assets are done, Sanic is working hard to give y'all a great OST, and the story is written for now. I hope after 8 month in developpement, hopefully it has been worth the wait. Peace, and see y'all next time !
