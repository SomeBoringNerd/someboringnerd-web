Hello everyone ! 
<br/>
Not an update blog, just a rant.
<br/>
So, AI is becoming better and better by the day. From a dev that dont use it otherwise, what can it do ? In this blog, I'll go over each and every AI tool that I know of and make the pros and cons of each.
<br/>
<article class="paragraph">
    <h1 class="text-4xl">ChatGPT</h1>
    <br/>
    Biggest of them first, ChatGPT, the infamous AI powered chatbot.
    <br/>
    Outside of the ethics, is it any good for my use case ? Well, depends.
    <br/>
    As I already said, my game is made in Jave with LibGDX, a framework to make stuff easier for me so i dont waste time and braincells with opengl binding and stuff i dont even understand.
    <br/>
    ChatGPT is capable of generating code, sometime code that is perfect, but for the time being, as someone who's familiar with Java and Libgdx, it dont provide anything of value for me.
    <br/>
    Although, there was one case where I can find use in it : 
    <br/>
    ***SAVING TIME***
    <br/>
    Yeah, there was *one* time where it was useful in the making of the game, was today (Friday Dec 01) when I finished a major rewrite of the dialogue system and needed to migrate every json file to a new format.

    <br/>
    Otherwise, for generating code, the way my engine work is too special for ChatGPT to help, and the very few time it could have, it didnt helped at all.

<article class="paragraph">
    <h1 class="text-4xl">Dall-E, Stable Diffusion, and other image generator</h1>
    <br/>
    First of all, using AI generated images is nothing more than theft. Those models are trained on millions of stolen images, draws, photos and so on and I would never use them in production.
    <br/>
    Although, unlike ChatGPT, I can see a clear usecase that is perfect and, in my opinion, ethically not *that* bad.
    <br/>
    ***Generating concept art***
    <br/>
    I'm a shit artist, both with a pen and paper and with a computer. All the pixel art was made by hand on Aseprite, and with little to no external inspiration. Having a way to visualize something exactly how I imagine it is really useful. Be re-assured, I am not putting ai generated content directly in the game, as **IT IS FUCKING THEFT**.

    <h1 class="text-4xl">AI Generated music</h1>
    <br/>
    The tech is just not made for video games, it is not possible to make properly looping musics, and AI generated music has no soul, there's no way to actually make a good and coherent OST.<br/>
    Like, there's not even a single pros using AI music over making it myself or paying someone to make them

<article class="paragraph">
    <h1 class="text-4xl">AI Text to Speech</h1>
    <br/>
    Technically, Text to Speech was already AI before, but the current AI text to speech is actually something I could use for the devlogs, as I have a lot of issues with my voice (trans folks definitively get me) and my english, while good written, is utter garbage when I try to speak (this time, french peoples get me).<br/><br/>
    Unfortunatly, none of those tools are made for Linux so I'll have to do it the usual way, wish me luck :p

    <h1 class="text-4xl">So, is AI any good ?</h1>
    <br/>
    Not for my use case !<br/>
    what, you expected me to make a good case and points ? do you even know where you are ?
