Hello world !
<br/>
unlike what I would have loved to tell you all, the demo is not playable yet.
<br/>
let's get right into it

<article class="paragraph">
    <h1 class="text-4xl">Fighting system</h1>
    <p>
        Due to wanting to make a complex fighting system, I have to write, more often than not in the blind, a lot of code (pic related) that is really weird and seems... I don't know, but that goes agaisnt everything I stand for in term of code.

            *yes those comments are in the codebase, I wrote that somewhere at 3 in the morning, don't judge.*
        </center>
        <br/>
        But no worry !
        Most of the code I wrote for the combat system seems to work as intended and the feature itself should be finished before the end of the month.
        <br/>
        *I would take it with a big grain of salt if I were you.*

As I said, writting that type of code is not something I'm used to. I need to make code that work, work well and work fast.

With that being said, there's also another M A S S I V E problem, that is that I dont have a working pathfinding implementation. I wrote about it last month, it is hard to make one that is both fast, precise and work as I want it to.
While I'm working on it, I'll just say that next time, I'll just use a library that do it if I find one.

<article class="paragraph">
    <h1 class="text-4xl">Story</h1>
    <p>
        While the story itself will not be fully revealed, I can share some !

        <br/>
        Whatever is censored is stuff that i'm not willing to share for now, either because it's not fully wrote yet or because it would be too much of a spoiler :p
        I also started to write more story and characters and now, I have some stuff I wonder about.
    </p>

With my ideas, I would want to add a "relationship" system in the game. Being a quest based game, the player is expected to take their time and play the game at whatever pace they feel like.
Something I'd want to add is a way to form friendship with some characters, so they can help you make the game easier (at the cost of forming and maintaining a friendship, but hey, surely you can do that :p).
<br/>
This is an idea i'm currently poking at. Once I finish the two other features (pathfinding, combat system along with a third secret feature), and the demo get playable, i'll start getting on that.
<br/>
Anyway, have a good one folks, and i'll see you next month. In the meanwhile, feel free to join my discord <a href="https://someboringnerd.xyz/discord">here !</a>
