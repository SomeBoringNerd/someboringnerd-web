*What do you mean I'm late ?*
<br/>
sorry about that, New Year was spent being with friends.
<br/>
anyway, happy new year everyone. During december, I havent done any significant progress, the only one being a new cutscene system, along with the developpement of internal tools to make my job easier. It dont help that I also have been working for another project (see <a href="/projects/sccda">my project folder</a> for more informations), but a lot of this time was spent thinking about what the game could be.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Fight System rant : Electric Boogaloo</h1>
<br/>
about my "fight system rant" from last blog, I got to talk with a few friends (including a random new friend found in a random ctf_2fort match) about ideas, I brainstormed some concepts that I would enjoy, rather than traditional (or less traditional) RPG / JRPG elements, and I found some interesting ideas : 
<br/>
\> A quest based system.
<br/>
In the greatest Pokémon game from the Wii era (or greatest at all), Poképark : Pikachu's Great Adventure, the way to progress is through gates that open upon uniting enough pokémons. To do so, you have to befriend them in many way, sometime by fighting them, playing hide and seek, more elabotated minigames and so on.
<br/>
Back when I was a little kid, I remember having a lot of fun doing said minigames, exploring areas, talking to pokémons, and more (I even 100%'d both games, that's how much I loved it).
<br/>
Those are game mecanics that I really enjoy, and would allow me to make characters that feel more alive.
<br/>
Appart from that, there's not much. I'm also rewritting major engine parts to make it less convoluted, bloated, buggy and/or overall shitty. I'm still planning to have a playable demo before the end of june, which will be a challenge to do, as I'm still working alone.
