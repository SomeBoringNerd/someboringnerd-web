Hello everyone ! 
<br/>
This month was not a really productive one, as most of my time was spent on getting a job (which I got, yey).
<br/>
Nonetheless, I still did *some* work, let's check this out : 
<br/>
<h1 class="text-4xl">Storyline</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    I've be writting some characters here and there. Other than that, I've been thinking about the fight system, in a lore point of view.
    <br/>
    After watching this video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LeftonReplay">Left On Replay</a>

    <br/>
    I noticed that by the way I wrote the concept of the game, there's no need for a combat system, it seems out of the blue and make the player kinda look like a dick. There's no reasons for the people you would meet to fight you, and no reason for you to fight them.
    <br/>
    <h1 class="text-2xl">**So, how can I fix that problem ?**</h1>
    <br/>
    The best idea I had was ripping one page off of Omori's book (That's like, one of my two inspirations for the game, you can easely guess the other one), in the game, you traverse multiple zones that are linked together, but ultimately, are unique in their own way.<br/><br/>

            *Exemple of zones in Omori, source : thegamer.com*
        </center>
    </a>
    <br/>
    This allows me to not only have unique zones, but also unique characters and justify the presence of that zone in one way or another. Some may be colorful and look welcoming, other gray and seem hostile. Who know, cant judge a book by its cover, just be careful around people that may seem *too* friendly :-)
    <br/><br/>
    And for the rest, I had some ideas in term of lore to justify the fight system, but it is too soon to reveal them. The only thing I'll say is that it required a major rewrite of the concept of the game itself.
    <br/>
    But even if I could add the combat system anyway, I'm kinda stuck with what kind of fight system I want to add. Traditionally, RPGs made a turn based fight system. Even RPGs with original fight systems are, ultimately, turn based.
    <br/>
    While it is fine for me, I want something that feel less... *slow*.
    <br/>
    Dont get me wrong, fights in Undertale for exemple are nowhere near the definition of slow, especially with the final bosses. What I mean by that is that the turn based combat give the player time to think about their next move, there's not as much "on the spot" pressure as real time fights.
    <br/>
    So, my only option here is real time fights. So huh, what now ?
    <br/>
    I'll just put a bunch of ideas here, somewhere down the line, I'll let all of you know which one I took, or if I made my own concept :p<br/><br/>

    \* I could inspire myself from Baddeline's boss fight from Celeste, it is fast, nervous but might be hard to adapt to a RPG (and also, that game is hard, died to her about 250 times in my first playthrough)<br/><br/>

    \* I could also take a page from Touhou : Luna's Night, where the fight is a real time bullet hell, but as a 2d platformer (My favorite, but might not be the best overall)<br/><br/>

    \* Lastly, I could make some minigames for each major enemies, instead of fighting, you might have to do a race as a platformer, do some challenge, or something like that, which would require a lot of work, but it would add more personality to characters you would encounter.<br/>
    <br/>

    Something to remember is that in my game, peace should ***ALWAYS*** be an option, and the player should be the one choosing between peace and war.

<h1 class="text-4xl">Demo advancement</h1>
<article class="paragraph">
    As I said earlier, I havent done a lot of code for the game, as I got a job for SandBlock Studios as a freelance dev, and, at the time of writting this, I have a job interview in a few hours (writting this a day later, it went really well, a few days after this blog post release, I have a second one).
    <br/>
    Anyway, the few lines I wrote were bug fixes and major engine changes to make writting code less of a pain.
    <br/>
    For instance, less and less things are hardcoded and are stored in .json files

        <br/>
        *Before that, only the tiles werent hardcoded*
    </center>
    <br/>
    It make it easier to integrate with the new map editor I've been showing lately, that also got a major revamp to make it easier to use for myself.
    <br/>
    As for now, Transcendance, the custom engine for the game, is wrote with a lot of spaghetti code, and while performance is not an issue **YET**, bugs, on the other hand, are.
    <br/>
    No worries though, most of them are easely fixed and usualy, fixing them bring a lot of QOL features that were either impossible or hard to implement.
    <br/>
    Nonetheless, I still was able to implement one room, and implement two minor character, with one having a much larger role somewhere down the story (I already wrote her role, by the way).

<article class="paragraph">
    So, with me getting one job, and on the right path for a second one, the time I have for the game is getting smaller and smaller.
    <br/>
    This is something I mostly anticipated, but with me having a steady source of income, I might be able to actually have the rescources to aim higher with this project.
    <br/>
    The devlog idea is still ongoing, my main issue is that Davinci Resolve dont support compressed codecs in the free version, so i'm stuck with 20go files, and my renders take 2 time my SSD's capacity.
    <br/>
    I didnt wanted to launch a funding campain before having a demo to show off, and i'm still going that way.
    <br/>
    With all of this being said, have a good one folks, see you next month or <a href="/discord" target="_blank">on my discord</a>, in the meantime, enjoy some concept art ;-)
